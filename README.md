# Friend-Finder

This app is a compatibility-based "Social-Matching" application -- basically a dating app. 
This full-stack site will take in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. 
The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 

The app is built on Express to handle routing. 
The app is deployed to Heroku.  Link here: [I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)
